/*11. Write a program to create a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division. The program should ask for two numbers (floating point) and
perform all the operations
Hint:
Create a variable number1 and number 2 and take user inputs.
Perform Arithmetic Operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division and
assign the result to a variable and finally print the result
I/P => number1, number2

O/P => The addition, subtraction, multiplication and division value of 2 numbers ___ and
___ is ___, ____, ____, and ___*/
