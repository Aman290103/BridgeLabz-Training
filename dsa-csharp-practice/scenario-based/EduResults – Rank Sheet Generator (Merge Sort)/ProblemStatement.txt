EduResults – Rank Sheet Generator (Merge Sort)
Story: An educational board compiles marks of thousands of students from different districts.
Each district submits a sorted list of students by score. The main server needs to merge and
sort all these lists into a final state-wise rank list. Merge Sort ensures efficiency and maintains
stability for duplicate scores.
Concepts Involved:
● Merge Sort
● Merging sorted sublists
● Large datasets with stable sorting
