E-Commerce Platform
Description: Develop a simplified e-commerce platform:
Create an abstract class Product with fields like productId, name, and price, and an abstract method CalculateDiscount().
Extend it into concrete classes: Electronics, Clothing, and Groceries.
Implement an interface ITaxable with methods CalculateTax() and GetTaxDetails() for applicable product categories.
Use encapsulation to protect product details, allowing updates only through setter methods.
Showcase polymorphism by creating a method that calculates and prints the final price (price + tax - discount) for a list of products.
