 Vehicle Rental System
Description: Design a system to manage vehicle rentals:
Define an abstract class Vehicle with fields like vehicleNumber, type, and rentalRate.
Add an abstract method CalculateRentalCost(int days).
Create subclasses Car, Bike, and Truck with specific implementations of CalculateRentalCost().
Use an interface IInsurable with methods CalculateInsurance() and GetInsuranceDetails().
Apply encapsulation to restrict access to sensitive details like insurance policy numbers.
Demonstrate polymorphism by iterating over a list of vehicles and calculating rental and insurance costs for each.
