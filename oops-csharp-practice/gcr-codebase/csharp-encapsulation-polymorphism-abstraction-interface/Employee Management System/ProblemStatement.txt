1. Employee Management System

Description: Build an employee management system with the following requirements:
Use an abstract class Employee with fields like employeeId, name, and baseSalary.
Provide an abstract method CalculateSalary() and a concrete method DisplayDetails().
Create two subclasses: FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee, implementing CalculateSalary() based on work hours or fixed salary.
Use encapsulation to restrict direct access to fields and provide properties for access.
Create an interface IDepartment with methods like AssignDepartment() and GetDepartmentDetails().
Ensure polymorphism by processing a list of employees and displaying their details using the Employee reference.
