Goal: Design a Bird Sanctuary system using Inheritance and Polymorphism.
Scenario: EcoWing Wildlife Conservation Center needs to track birds.● Attributes: defined in base class Bird.
● Interfaces: IFlyable (method Fly()), ISwimmable (method Swim()).
● Derived Classes: Eagle, Sparrow (implement IFlyable), Duck, Penguin (implement
ISwimmable), Seagull (implements both).
●Use Array Concept
● Polymorphism: Iterate through list, check interface type (is IFlyable), and call
methods.
